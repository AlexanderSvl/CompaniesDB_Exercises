# ðŸ“ˆ Stock Market Database Project

## ðŸš€ Overview

Welcome to the **Stock Market Database Project**! This project is designed to manage and analyze financial data of various companies. The database consists of multiple tables that store information related to stocks, dividends, financials, stock prices, analyst ratings, and shareholders. 

This project serves as a **practical exercise** to enhance my SQL skills, including data manipulation, querying, and database design.
